{\Large \textbf{Abstract:}}

Social media mining is one of the most studied areas of data mining in recent years.  In both business and research, these techniques arouse a great deal of interest because with proper processing can be obtained a large amount of information and value of data that apriori seem desecruturados. In this work, we propose a system based on text mining for social media analysis through which a flow of data analysis will be given in Big Data on Twitter. This will be achieved through the analysis of patterns, provided by association rules, whose usefulness in this field of application will be verified in the exhaustive study of the state of the art carried out. Various techniques for extracting rules are discussed and purchased, as well as the limitations of the usual algorithms, which have been shown to be of little use in problems framed in the Big Data paradigm. In order to be able to verify that the results are acceptable or conform to reality, the system will be tested with a case of real use of Big Data on the general elections of the Government of Spain on the 28th of April, showing the good functioning of the system, despite having more than 1.5 million transactions.
